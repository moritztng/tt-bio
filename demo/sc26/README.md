# SC26 booth demo

A protein folding live on four Tenstorrent Blackhole chips, drawn as point clouds and molecular
surfaces. Runs fully offline on one QuietBox 2.

Served at http://127.0.0.1:8626/ with its frame stream at `/stream` on the same origin.
The stream format is in [PROTOCOL.md](PROTOCOL.md); booth staff read [BOOTH.md](BOOTH.md).

| path | what |
|------|------|
| `engine/` | fold workers, one per chip, and the stream server |
| `gallery/` | curated proteins and their recorded trajectories |
| `web/render/` | WebGL renderer: points, surfaces, camera |
| `web/app/` | the kiosk app, attract loop and interaction |
| `hardware/` | per-chip telemetry |
| `ops/` | boot-to-demo service, watchdogs, recovery |

The model hooks the demo uses are flag-gated and off by default; nothing here changes a fold's
result.
